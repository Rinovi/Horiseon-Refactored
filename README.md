# Module Challenge 1

## Description

This was the first module challenge for the ASU coding bootcamp. The purpose of this challenge was to help solidify and familiarize students with what clean html semantic element code should look like. It did this by giving us a completed website with generic semantic element labels, and asking us to refactor the code. The website itself promotes Horiseon Social Sultion Services, an incorporation that can assist with things such as SEO, online reputation management, social media marketing, etc.

## Usage

Although this version of the deployed website does not have much use, anyone who is new to coding, or just looking to brush up their skills, can clone the source code from this repo. https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram
This will allow you to repeat the exercise and refactor the code just as we did in this module 1 challenge.
